# MC Case Study

This code was written to support the case study for Methylene Chloride for the paper named Data engineering for tracking chemicals and releases at industrial end-of-life activities.

Note: In order to run the code you need to have the EoL database which is obtained as explained in the above paper

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required for running the code:

1. numpy (https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
2. plotly (https://pypi.org/project/plotly/)
3. pandas (https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)

## Use

In order to run the code you will need to input:

1. The sample size for calculating indirect releases
2. The internal tracking number for the chemical in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Substance Registry Services (https://ofmpub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/substreg/LandingPage.do)
3. The file where the EoL database is located (the current version is in private repository)
